# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project implements a sentiment analysis model using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to classify movie reviews as positive or negative. The model is trained on a balanced dataset of movie reviews and leverages Keras and TensorFlow for deep learning.

## Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenizes and pads sequences for input into the LSTM model.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes an LSTM architecture with embedding layers for sentiment classification.
- **Custom Callbacks**: Implements F1 score evaluation during training for better performance metrics.
- **Prediction Capability**: Ability to predict sentiment on new movie reviews.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
